Hey! This is a solution that I am currently working on: <br>
<ul>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Integration testing</li>
<li>Gitlab pipelines</li>
<li>Microservices & mTLS</li>
<li> Node.js & Express.js </li>
</ul>

The reverse proxy (NGINX) is serving a static index.html. From this static website it is possible as the client to send data to the central platform (cerahealth). Based on the selected receiver, the data will be formatted in a certain way. <br>
This project was primarily made to show at a jobinterview with Region Syddanmark. Unfourtanely, I was too much of a timeoptimist and with too much around my ears, so it did not get ready in its raw format for the jobinterview itself. <br>
Now it is a sandbox to try out different techs, frameworks, design-patterns etc. etc.
