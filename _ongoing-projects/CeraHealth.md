Hey! This is a solution that I am currently working on to get working with:
Unit testing,
Integration testing,
Gitlab pipelines
Microservices & mTLS
The reverse proxy (NGINX) is serving a static index.html. From this static website it is possible as the client to send data to the central platform (cerahealth). Based on receiver the data will be formatted in a certain way. 
This project was primarily made to show at a jobinterview with Region Syddanmark. Unfourtanely, I was too much of a timeoptimist and with too much around my ears, so it did not get ready in its raw format for the jobinterview itself.
